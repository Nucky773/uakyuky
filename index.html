    <h3>The Importance of Reading</h3>

    <p><b>Thesis:</b><br>
    I personally think that reading is a very important activity in our life. Why do I say so?</p>

    <p><b>Argument:</b><br>
    Firstly, by reading we can get a lot of knowledge about many things in the world such as science, technology, sports, arts, culture, etc written in either books, magazines, or newspapers.<br><br>
    Secondly, by reading we can get a lot of news and information about something happening in any parts of the world which we cannot see directly.<br><br>
    Another reason, reading can give us pleasure too. When we are tired, we read books, novels, comics, newspapers, or magazines in the entertainment column such as comedy, short stories, quizzes, etc. to make us relaxed.<br><br>
    Lastly, reading can also take us to other parts of the world. By reading a book about Irian Jaya we may feel we’re really sitting in the jungles, not at home in our rooms.
    </p>

    <p><b>Recommendation:</b><br>
    From the facts above, it’s obvious that everyone needs to read to get knowledge, information, and also entertainment. In summary, we can say reading is truly important in our life.
